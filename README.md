# Predicting-Developer-Salaries-and-Analyzing-Skill-Demand-Trends
Project Idea
In today’s fast-moving tech world, figuring out how your skills affect your salary is crucial for your career. Our project is all about creating a model that predicts a developer’s salary based on things like skills, experience, education, and other personal details. We’ll also look at how the demand for different skills has changed over time using survey data. By doing this, we hope to help developers understand which skills are worth focusing on now and in the future, so they can stay ahead in the job market.

Background
In the tech industry, your salary can depend on all kinds of things, like what skills you have, how much experience you’ve got, your education, and even where you live. Developers always need to keep up with new technologies, but it’s not always clear which skills are most in demand or which ones will get them paid more. That's where our project comes in. We want to use real survey data to create a model that helps developers make smarter career choices.
The goal is to give developers, HR teams, and even educational institutions a clearer picture of what skills really matter in today’s tech world. It’s about taking the guesswork out of career planning

Problem
Even though there’s a ton of data about developers, their skills, and their salaries, there isn’t one solid model that connects everything together in a way that’s easy to use. Developers often don’t know which skills will help them earn more, and figuring out what to learn next can be a challenge. Plus, there’s so much data scattered around in different places, it’s tough to make sense of it all.
We see an opportunity to fill that gap. By analyzing the data in a meaningful way, we can help developers make better career choices, focus on the right skills, and stay competitive in the job market.

Aim and Research Questions
Our project aims to create a model that can predict a developer’s salary based on their skills, experience, education, and other personal factors. We’ll also analyze how the demand for certain skills has shifted over time.
Here are the main questions we want to answer:
What skills have the biggest impact on a developer's salary?


How has the demand for different skills changed over the years?


Can we build a model that accurately predicts salaries based on these factors?

Feasibility
To make this work, we’ll be using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey data, which is publicly available and gives us a lot of useful information on developer skills, experience, education, and salaries. We’ve already checked that we can access the data, so that’s not a problem.
Here’s our plan:
Data Sources: We’ll mainly rely on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey data.


Methods: We’ll use statistical and machine learning techniques, like regression models, to predict salaries and analyze skill trends.


Risks: One risk is that the survey might not fully represent all regions or job roles, but we can mitigate that by adding extra data from other salary reports if needed.
